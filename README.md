# logging


"I'm an idiot. I stole most of this from other people, and it's not particularly relevant to O365. Disclaimers aside, this is what I put at the beginnings of my scripts. The first part will create a log whenever it runs with a timestamp, the second I use to record some fatal exceptions. I made the "Exit-Script" function because otherwise the transcript never stops."
